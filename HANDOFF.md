# Session Handoff — 2026-04-16

## Completed

- **CLAUDE.md** created at `CLAUDE.md`
- **Datasets packaged** as lazy-loaded R data objects:
  - `data/movies.rda` — 1000 IMDB movies (rating ≥ 7.0, 1970–2024), 7
    columns incl. comma-delimited `genres`
  - `data/actors.rda` — 25636-row actor–movie long-format table
  - `R/data.R` — roxygen2 docs for both datasets
  - `inst/extdata/` CSVs removed (replaced by `.rda`)
- **Shiny app** at `inst/shiny/cooccur_app/app.R`:
  - [`launch_app()`](http://saqr.me/cooccur/reference/launch_app.md)
    exported from `R/launch_app.R`
  - Upload CSV first in radio buttons
  - Build network button near top
  - Summary tab with export strip (CSV, Gephi, GraphML)
  - “View edge table” tab with DT
  - Network tab using
    [`cograph::splot()`](https://sonsoles.me/cograph/reference/splot.html)
    scaled by degree
  - Export tab (separate button IDs `dl_csv2`, `dl_gephi2`,
    `dl_graphml2`)
  - Footer with authors + chapter links
- **Authors**: Mohammed Saqr, Sonsoles López-Pernas, Kamila Misiejuk
  added to `DESCRIPTION`, `README.md`, and app footer (all with website
  links)
- **CRAN checks**: 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes
- **`weight_by` parameter** added to
  [`cooccurrence()`](http://saqr.me/cooccur/reference/cooccurrence.md) /
  [`co()`](http://saqr.me/cooccur/reference/cooccurrence.md):
  - Long format only (`field` + `by`)
  - Computes `C[i,j] = sum_d(w_id * w_jd)` — designed for LDA
    topic-document probability matrices
  - `count` column retains binary co-occurrence count
  - Works with all similarity measures, scaling, `min_occur`,
    `threshold`, `top_n`, `split_by`
  - 8 tests added
- **`field = "all"`** for wide sequence format:
  - Removes silent catch-all that misclassified any non-binary data
    frame
  - Non-binary data frame without `field = "all"` now errors with
    helpful message
  - Binary 0/1 matrices still auto-detected

## Current State

All tests passing: 236 PASS, 0 FAIL, 2 SKIP (optional packages). Package
passes `devtools::check()` with 0 errors/warnings/notes. Repo is clean
and up to date with `origin/main`.

## Key Decisions

- `weight_by` restricted to long format only — avoids ambiguity with
  other formats
- `field = "all"` chosen over `format = "wide"` (avoids confusion with
  `output` arg) or `sequences = TRUE` (less general)
- `count` column in weighted path reflects binary presence (not weighted
  sum) — preserves interpretability
- `LazyData: true` + xz-compressed `.rda` requires
  `Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)`
- All heavy dependencies (`igraph`, `cograph`, `Nestimate`, `tidygraph`)
  stay in `Suggests`

## Open Issues

- Shiny app Export tab buttons (`dl_csv2` etc.) work but are separate
  from Summary tab strip — minor UX duplication
- `pkgdown` site workflow added by remote — not yet verified it builds
  correctly
- `vignettes/imdb-tutorial.Rmd` had scratchpad edits stashed — stash was
  not popped, those edits are lost (they referenced `human_cat`, `tna`,
  `rio` — unrelated to this package)

## Next Steps

- Update vignette to demonstrate `weight_by` with a toy LDA example
- Update README to document `field = "all"` and `weight_by`
- Consider whether `field = "all"` should also accept character matrices
  (currently only data frames trigger the old wide catch-all path)
- pkgdown site: verify `.github/workflows/pkgdown.yaml` deploys
  correctly
