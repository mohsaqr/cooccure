# Session Handoff — 2026-04-21

## Completed

- **Sparse engine rewrite** (`56bee35`): `cooccurrence()` / `co()` now stay in
  sparse representation end-to-end. Previously allocated dense `n x k` and
  `k x k` matrices, which hit R's 16 GB vector memory limit on realistic
  citation corpora (> ~100k unique refs). New pipeline:
  `Matrix::sparseMatrix` for incidence, `Matrix::crossprod` for co-occurrence,
  triplet-based similarity normalisation and scaling, `Matrix::triu` for
  upper-triangle edge extraction. `attr(x, "matrix")` and
  `attr(x, "raw_matrix")` are now sparse `Matrix` objects; `as_matrix()`
  densifies on demand. Added `Matrix` + `methods` to `Imports`.

- **Vectorised delimited parser** (`e9b2b89`): `.co_parse_delimited` and
  `.co_parse_multi_delimited` now flatten once, call `trimws()` on the
  whole token vector, and reconstruct transactions via `split()` with a
  preserved level range. Per-row `unique()` replaced with a single
  `duplicated(data.frame(row_idx, flat))` pass. New `.co_relist_unique()`
  helper.

- **Equivalence guards** (`79671c9`, `65ade5c`):
  - Regression test: new parser vs inline copy of the old per-row
    `trimws` path on 2000-row synthetic noisy data (blank tokens,
    padding, duplicates, NA rows). Bit-identical.
  - Cross-validation vs `biblionetwork::biblio_cocitation()` (Goutsmedt
    et al., Leiden). Exact set equality on edges, tolerance 1e-10 on
    weights, identical counts.

- **Downstream adjustments**: `as_matrix.cooccurrence` handles sparse
  attributes; `plot.cooccurrence` routes through `as_matrix()` for
  consistent densification. `.co_core_weighted` (long format with
  `weight_by`) rewritten to use `sparseMatrix` builders.

## Current State

- Repo clean, `main` pushed to `origin`. Head: `65ade5c`.
- Version bumped to **0.1.1** (`DESCRIPTION`, `NEWS.md`).
- `devtools::test()`: **250 pass, 0 fail, 3 skip** (expected skips:
  `tidygraph`/`Nestimate` missing-package-path tests that can't run when
  the packages ARE installed, and the `bibnets` cross-check since
  bibnets isn't installed as a library on this machine).
- `devtools::check(..., --no-tests --no-examples --no-vignettes)`:
  **0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes**.

## Performance on a 166,017-row citation dataset (fractional counting)

| Stage                          | Runtime | Edges      | Status |
|--------------------------------|---------|------------|--------|
| Original dense engine (pre-fix) | OOM at 16 GB | — | Fails |
| After sparse rewrite (`56bee35`) | 6.19 s  | 6,214,159 | Works |
| After vectorised parser (`e9b2b89`) | **3.39 s median** | 6,214,159 | Works |

Peak R memory on the full run: ~456 MB. `biblionetwork::biblio_cocitation`
on the same data: 6.45 s. Edge-for-edge equivalence: **max abs weight
diff = 0.000e+00** across all 6.2M edges.

## Key Decisions

- **Kept `data.table` out of `Imports`** — profiling showed the parser
  (not edge munging) was the bottleneck; vectorising the parser saved
  ~2 s at zero dependency cost, while `data.table` would have added a
  3 MB compiled dependency for a marginal gain on `order()`. Aligns with
  the "lean dependencies" posture of sister packages (`bibnets`).
- **Sparse attributes exposed, not hidden** — `attr(x, "matrix")` is
  now a `dsCMatrix`/`dgCMatrix` rather than a dense `matrix`. Power
  users can avoid `as_matrix()` on huge networks; casual users who call
  `as_matrix()` get the same base-matrix behaviour as before.
- **`"relative"` similarity keeps both triangles explicit** — it's the
  only asymmetric measure, so the `matrix` attribute stores a full
  `dgCMatrix`. Avoids the `dsCMatrix` → `TsparseMatrix` trap where only
  one triangle's triplets are exposed.

## Open Issues

- Pre-existing: `actor_genres` dataset still produces ~172k edges with
  default settings — Shiny Network tab unrenderable without filtering.
- Pre-existing: Shiny production server not redeployed this session.
- Pre-existing: first CRAN submission has not been made. Preflight
  still passes after the 0.1.1 changes (re-run `check(cran = TRUE)`
  before submitting to be safe).

## Next Steps

1. **CRAN submission of 0.1.1** — preflight currently clean; run
   `devtools::check_win_devel()` + `devtools::release()` when ready.
2. Attention-weighted co-occurrence (carried from 2026-04-20 handoff) —
   new `similarity = "attention"` or `counting = "attention"` branch
   following the pattern used in `tna-dev`.
3. Resolve the `actor_genres` Shiny Network-tab edge count issue.
4. Redeploy Shiny production server. The server directory still sits at
   `/srv/shiny-server/cooccur`; rename it to `cooccure` to match the
   package rename, then run:
   `cd /srv/shiny-server/cooccure && sudo git pull && sudo systemctl restart shiny-server`.

## Context

- Package: `cooccure` v0.1.1, GitHub at `mohsaqr/cooccure`, main branch.
  (Renamed from `cooccur` on 2026-04-22 to avoid a CRAN name collision
  with an unrelated archived package.)
- Authors: Mohammed Saqr, Sonsoles López-Pernas, Kamila Misiejuk.
- Shiny production host: `/srv/shiny-server/cooccure` (server directory
  still needs to be renamed — workflow points at the new name).
- r-universe: `mohsaqr.r-universe.dev/cooccure` (registry updated
  2026-04-22 in commit `e69d6bc` on `mohsaqr/mohsaqr.r-universe.dev`).
- Key equivalence-verification dataset:
  `/Users/mohammedsaqr/Downloads/datassss/testdata0421.csv` (166,017 rows
  of scholarly citations, semicolon-delimited).
- **Never add Co-Authored-By Claude to commit messages.**
- **For DESCRIPTION references, cite only Saqr/López-Pernas works — do
  not re-add van Eck or Perianes-Rodriguez.**
