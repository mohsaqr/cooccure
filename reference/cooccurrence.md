## Arguments

- data:

  Input data. Accepts:

  - A `data.frame` with a delimited column (`field` + `sep`).

  - A `data.frame` in long/bipartite format (`field` + `by`).

  - A binary (0/1 or `TRUE`/`FALSE`) `data.frame` or `matrix`
    (auto-detected).

  - A one-hot or count table with `vars` naming the indicator columns;
    other columns (ids, metadata) are ignored.

  - A wide sequence `data.frame` or `matrix` (non-binary).

  - A `list` of character vectors (each element is a transaction).

  - A `nestimate_data` object from
    [`Nestimate::prepare()`](https://pak.dynasite.org/Nestimate/reference/prepare.html);
    its `sequence_data` is used, so event logs can be sessionized there
    and networked here.

- field:

  Character. The entity column — determines what the nodes are. For
  delimited format, a single column split by `sep`. For long/bipartite,
  the item column. For multi-column delimited, a vector of column names
  pooled per row. Use `field = "all"` for wide sequence data (e.g.
  TraMineR / tna format) where every column is a time point and cell
  values are the items.

- by:

  Character or `NULL`. Grouping column for long/bipartite format. Each
  unique value defines one transaction.

- sep:

  Character or `NULL`. Separator for splitting delimited fields.

- weight_by:

  Character or `NULL`. Column name containing a numeric association
  strength for each entity-transaction pair. Only accepted for long
  format (`field` + `by`). When supplied, each entity contributes its
  weight rather than 1, so \\C\_{ij} = \sum_d w\_{id} \cdot w\_{jd}\\.
  Typical use: topic-document probability matrices from LDA or similar
  models.

- split_by:

  Character or `NULL`. Column name to split the data by before computing
  co-occurrence. A separate network is computed per group and the
  results are combined into a single data frame with an additional
  `group` column. Only works with data.frame inputs.

- similarity:

  Character. Similarity measure:

  `"none"`

  :   Raw co-occurrence counts.

  `"jaccard"`

  :   \\C\_{ij} / (f_i + f_j - C\_{ij})\\.

  `"cosine"`

  :   Salton's cosine: \\C\_{ij} / \sqrt{f_i \cdot f_j}\\.

  `"inclusion"`

  :   Simpson coefficient: \\C\_{ij} / \min(f_i, f_j)\\.

  `"association"`

  :   Association strength: \\C\_{ij} / (f_i \cdot f_j)\\ (van Eck &
      Waltman, 2009).

  `"dice"`

  :   \\2 C\_{ij} / (f_i + f_j)\\.

  `"equivalence"`

  :   Salton's cosine squared: \\C\_{ij}^2 / (f_i \cdot f_j)\\.

  `"relative"`

  :   Row-normalized: each row sums to 1.

- counting:

  Character. Counting method:

  `"full"`

  :   Each co-occurring pair adds 1 regardless of transaction size.
      Default.

  `"fractional"`

  :   Each pair adds \\1 / (n_i - 1)\\ where \\n_i\\ is the number of
      items in transaction \\i\\. Transactions with many items
      contribute less per pair (Perianes-Rodriguez et al., 2016).

  `"attention"`

  :   Each pair within a transaction contributes \\\exp(-\|pos_i -
      pos_j\| / \lambda)\\ — closer positions give a stronger edge,
      distant pairs decay. Requires ordered transactions (list / wide /
      delimited / windowed input). The decay rate \\\lambda\\ is
      controlled by the `lambda` argument.

- scale:

  Character or `NULL`. Optional scaling applied to weights after
  similarity normalization:

  `NULL` or `"none"`

  :   No scaling.

  `"minmax"`

  :   Min-max to \\\[0, 1\]\\.

  `"log"`

  :   Natural log: \\\log(1 + w)\\.

  `"log10"`

  :   Log base 10: \\\log\_{10}(1 + w)\\.

  `"binary"`

  :   Binary: 1 if \\w \> 0\\, else 0.

  `"zscore"`

  :   Z-score standardization.

  `"sqrt"`

  :   Square root.

  `"proportion"`

  :   Divide by sum of all weights.

- threshold:

  Numeric. Minimum edge weight to retain, applied after similarity and
  scaling. The default `0` means no filtering rather than "drop negative
  weights", so centering scalings such as `scale = "zscore"` keep their
  negative half. Pass a positive value to filter.

- min_occur:

  Integer. Minimum entity frequency. Entities appearing in fewer than
  `min_occur` transactions are dropped. Default 1.

- top_n:

  Integer or `NULL`. Keep only the top `top_n` edges by weight. When
  `split_by` is used, applied per group. Default `NULL` (all edges).

- output:

  Character. Column naming convention for the output:

  `"default"`

  :   `from`, `to`, `weight`, `count`.

  `"gephi"`

  :   `Source`, `Target`, `Weight`, `Type` (= `"Undirected"`). Ready for
      Gephi import.

  `"igraph"`

  :   Returns an `igraph` graph object directly.

  `"cograph"`

  :   Returns a `cograph_network` object directly.

  `"matrix"`

  :   Returns the square co-occurrence matrix.

- vars:

  Column specification or `NULL`. The indicator (one-hot) columns, one
  column per item. Resolved like `select` in
  [`subset`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/subset.html), so all of these work:
  a bare range (`vars = A:D`), bare names (`vars = c(A, B, C)`),
  positions (`vars = 2:5`), negative selection (`vars = -c(id, note)`),
  a logical mask, or a character vector. Every other column — ids,
  timestamps, metadata — is ignored, so a one-hot table that also
  carries identifier columns needs no pre-processing. Cell values are
  read as presence: any non-zero, non-`NA` value marks the item present,
  so count tables such as document-term matrices work as well as `0`/`1`
  and `TRUE`/`FALSE`. `NA` counts as absent. Cannot be combined with
  `field`, `by`, or `sep`. A purely binary table with no extra columns
  is still auto-detected without `vars`.

- actor:

  Character vector or `NULL`. Column(s) identifying who performed the
  action. When `NULL`, all rows are treated as one actor. Only used with
  `action`.

- action:

  Character or `NULL`. Column holding the event/state for raw event-log
  input. When supplied, the log is sessionized into ordered sequences
  first and each session becomes one transaction, so `window` and
  `counting = "attention"` apply. Requires the Nestimate package, which
  performs the sessionization.

- time:

  Character or `NULL`. Timestamp column. Accepts ISO8601, Unix time, and
  common date/time formats. When `NULL`, row order defines the sequence.
  Only used with `action`.

- session:

  Character vector or `NULL`. Column(s) giving an explicit session
  grouping. Combined with `time`, sessions are further split on time
  gaps. Only used with `action`.

- order:

  Character or `NULL`. Column used to break ties when timestamps are
  identical. Only used with `action`.

- time_threshold:

  Numeric. Maximum gap in seconds between consecutive events before a
  new session starts. Use `Inf` to keep each actor as a single sequence
  regardless of gaps. Default 900 (15 minutes). Only used with `action`
  and `time`.

- group:

  Character or `NULL`. Alias for `split_by`.

- aggregate_by:

  Character or `NULL`. Column name to group the data by before computing
  co-occurrence. For each unique value, the per-group network is
  computed (with the chosen `similarity`, `counting`, `scale`,
  `window`); the per-group edge weights are then combined across groups
  via `aggregate` into ONE final network. Differs from `split_by`, which
  keeps groups separate. Cannot be combined with `split_by`. Only
  applies to data frame inputs.

- aggregate:

  Character. How to combine edge weights across groups when
  `aggregate_by` is used: `"sum"` (default), `"mean"`, `"min"`, or
  `"max"`. The `count` column is always summed. `threshold` and `top_n`
  are applied AFTER aggregation.

- window:

  Integer or `NULL`. Sliding-window size for categorical time-series /
  ordered-sequence input. When set to an integer \\w \ge 2\\, every
  window of `w` consecutive positions in a sequence becomes a
  mini-transaction; states inside the same window co-occur. Sequences
  shorter than `w` contribute no transactions. Only applies to ordered
  formats: wide (`field = "all"`) and `list`. Default `NULL` (whole
  sequence treated as one transaction — bag of states).

- lambda:

  Numeric. Decay rate for `counting = "attention"`. Higher `lambda` →
  slower decay → distant pairs still contribute. Default `1.0`, matching
  the tna package. Ignored for other counting methods.

- ...:

  Currently unused.

## Value

Depends on `output`:

- `"default"`: A `cooccurrence` data frame with columns `from`, `to`,
  `weight`, `count` (and `group` when `split_by` is used).

- `"gephi"`: A data frame with columns `Source`, `Target`, `Weight`,
  `Type`, `Count`. Ready for Gephi CSV import.

- `"igraph"`: An `igraph` graph object.

- `"cograph"`: A `cograph_network` object.

- `"matrix"`: A square numeric co-occurrence matrix.

For the data frame outputs, rows are sorted by weight descending and
attributes store the full matrix, item frequencies, and parameters.
